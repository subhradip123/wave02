Architecture details:(Distributed non-clustered environment)

1. Universal forwarder: Install splunk universal forwarder package. It only have CLI , no GUI.
We use two conf files there.
inputs.conf : ingest the data.
outputs.conf : to which instance the data need to forward.

2. Heavy forwarder: (props.conf, transforms.conf)
a> parsing(props.conf)
This is Shree. This is Krishna. This is Sajida. This is Susmita.

This is Shree. 

This is Krishna. 

This is Sajida. 

This is Susmita.

b> masking:
Krishna acc number 1234567899876 has debited rs.2000.

Krishna acc number xxxxxxxxxx876 has debited rs.2000.

c> filtering (transforms.conf)

Shee has logged in from 192.168.35.22

Krishna has logged in from 192.168.35.21

Sajida has logged out from 192.168.35.25

Sushmita has logged out from 192.168.35.26

If we want only log oug related logs, we can ingest those only filtering out the log in related logs.
By doing this we are getting very neat data for our visulizations and we are saving license usage.

3. Indexer: (indexes.conf)
Index is the path or directory where we store the data.

4. LM: License master:
a> License stacking:
100gb/day + 50 gb/day --->150 gb/day.

b> License pooling:
100 gb/day.

pool A: 80 gb/day -> Idx
pool B: 20 gb/day -> SH, DS

License limit exceed > 5 times in a rolling period of 30 days.

17th march -> 1

17th april -> 5

< 6.5(splunk version) -->Indexing continues but cant search the data --> 'litsearch error'
>= 6.5(splunk version) -->Indexing continues, you can search the data, but splunk can take legal action against you or your organization.

License got expired -> Indexing continues. But searches are blocked.

License master goes down -> >72hrs then indexing continues, searches are blocked.
